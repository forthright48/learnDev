# Learning Development

While learning development, a beginner needs to cover lots of topics. As a beginner myself, I decided to track the useful resources in one place.

# Authentication
1. [Authenticate a NodeJS API with JSON Web Tokens](https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens)  
A simple tutorial that shows how to use jsonwebtoken module to use JWT with API for authentication.


# BootStrap
1. [Vertical Align Columns in Row in BootStrap](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28077398/twitter-bootstrap-3-vertical-align-columns-in-a-row-middle)  
The code snippet for `v.center` works like a charm.

# Express
1. [Why can I execute code after `res.send`?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16180502/node-express-why-can-i-execute-code-after-res-send)  
`res.send()` simply closes the response. The function is free to continue as long as it does not attempt to call methods on `res`. So, better to use `return` where we want things to stop.

# MongoDB
1. [Checking if a document exists â€“ MongoDB slow findOne vs find](https://blog.serverdensity.com/checking-if-a-document-exists-mongodb-slow-findone-vs-find/)  
Using `db.find().limit(1)` is faster than using `db.findOne()`. Oh well, I will still use findOne() since I don't need ultra optimization.

# Security
1. [How to Safely Store a Password](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/)  
Emphasis on use of **bcrypt** for encrypting password. Using MD5, SH1 and others is not safe as they are fast and can be broken using brute force. bcrypt is safe cause it's slow.

1. [What are rainbow tables and how are they used?](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/379/what-are-rainbow-tables-and-how-are-they-used)  
  Seems like there is a difference between Rainbow attack and Dictionary attack

1. [Why is using salt more secure?](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/14025/why-is-using-salt-more-secure)  
Salt does not protect a single password. All it does, in case of leak of password database, is make it harder to use dictionary attack and crack multiple passwords in one go.
